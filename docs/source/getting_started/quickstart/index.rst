This quickstart guide will walk you through the process of creating a Brisk
project. It will cover the basics of how projects are organized and show you how
to train models using Brisk.

Brisk is a framework that aims to make `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_
more accessible and easier to use by providing a more structured approach to
experimentation. It provides built-in evaluation methods, plotting methods, and
other tools. The goal is to make it easier for non-programmers get started with
machine learning by reducing the amount of code you need to write and maintain.

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a Brisk project,
setting up all the necessary configurations, training some models, and
evaluating results. This guide is focused on using Brisk and will not go in
depth on the machine learning concepts. Brisk is a tool that helps you
experiment with machine learning models but it does not replace the need to
understand the underlying concepts.
